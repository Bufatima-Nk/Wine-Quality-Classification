# Wine Quality Classification Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Wine Quality Classification project repository! This project focuses on predicting the quality of wines using machine learning techniques. It involves exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, feature selection, model creation, and evaluation. The project covers both white and red wines, aiming to provide insights into the factors influencing wine quality.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are to:

- Predict the quality of white and red wines using classification algorithms.
- Explore the dataset to gain insights into key features affecting wine quality.
- Implement data preprocessing techniques, including outlier removal and feature selection.
- Train and evaluate Random Forest classifiers to achieve accurate predictions.
- Provide a clear understanding of the factors contributing to wine quality.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:
- [Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)
